# Documentation for [TerrabaseDB](https://terrabasedb.com)

> **NOTE:** This is currently a work in progress

Welcome to TerrabaseDB's docs! You will find information about how you can get started with TDB, installation options, configuration and clients.

## Users

We have an easy-to-follow guide for [Getting Started](./Getting-Started.md). Once you've got everything up and running, you can take a look at the available actions [here](./List-Of-Actions.md) and [configuration files](./tdb-configuration.md).

## Developers	

You can find information on how to build your own clients [here](./Protocols/terrapipe.md). The primary idea is to implement the Terrapipe Protocol.
